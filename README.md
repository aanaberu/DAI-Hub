### #1 Platform engineering slows down development
Platform engineering, when implemented correctly, is designed to be a productivity booster, not a creativity crusher. One of the main goals of platform engineering is to enhance developer experience. This leads to developers being more effective and capable of delivering secure, stable, and supported code sooner, which in turn provides greater business agility, innovation, and reduced time to market.

Traditionally, development teams spend precious time wrestling with infrastructure complexities—setting up servers, configuring environments, managing dependencies, managing existing services and ensuring onboarding for new members is fast and quickly. The discipline of platform engineering steps in as the knight in shining armor, automating these tedious tasks, ensuring there is a central point of technology access, knowledge and services supported by a team with a single role of removing friction and increasing developer productivity. Imagine a team facing a mountain of infrastructure hurdles. Platform engineering blasts a tunnel right through that mountain, allowing development teams to focus on what they do best—deliver compelling software solutions. 

Furthermore, by providing pre-configured environments and self-service tools through a single pane of glass, platform engineering empowers development teams to spin up new environments on demand (either on-premises, cloud or even on the edge), accelerating development lifecycles and letting them focus on the solution.  

### #2 Platform engineering sacrifices security and governance for speed

Platform engineering, when implemented effectively, can actually be a champion for both speed and security.

Modern platforms naturally present complete security features that safeguard your applications and data. These features may include role-based access control (RBAC), which ensures only authorized users have access to specific resources. Additionally, features like network segmentation and containerization help isolate applications and prevent security breaches from spreading. 

Platform engineering also leverages automation to handle many of the tedious tasks traditionally associated with security. For example, automated vulnerability scanning and patching can identify and address security risks quickly, freeing up security teams to focus on more strategic initiatives. Think of it like a team of security robots—they tirelessly scan for vulnerabilities, allowing your human security experts to concentrate on complex threats.

Compliance is another area where platform engineering shines. Many platforms are designed to be compliant with various industry regulations. This means they offer built-in features and configurations that help organizations meet compliance requirements more efficiently. Imagine having pre-built security checklists and automated compliance reports—the platform simplifies the compliance process, allowing developers to focus on building secure applications.

Platform engineering can actually improve governance by providing a centralized platform for managing resources and enforcing policies. This ensures consistency and reduces the risk of shadow IT, where developers use unauthorized tools or infrastructure. Think of it like a well-organized city—the platform establishes clear rules and guidelines, promoting efficient development without stifling innovation.

By prioritizing built-in security features, leveraging automation, simplifying compliance, and streamlining governance, platform engineering can be a powerful ally in the quest for secure and efficient development

### #3 Platform engineering is a lone wolf's game
Successful platform engineering is all about teamwork and collaboration. It starts with product teams and designers, who understand what users need and where they face problems. Their insights help shape the platform so that it makes not only developers' jobs easier and more efficient but every project members. Security specialists are also crucial. They make sure the platform is safe from the start by building strong defenses against hackers and other threats. This helps protect the company's data and keeps everything secure.

Operations teams are the ones who integrate the new platform with the existing systems. They ensure that everything works together smoothly without causing interruptions. They also keep the platform running reliably, fixing any issues that come up so there’s no downtime. Another key part of this teamwork is open communication with stakeholders across the company. This means talking regularly with everyone involved to make sure everyone’s on the same page and working toward the same goals. When the platform engineering team knows the bigger picture, they can make decisions that support the company’s overall success.

By working together like this, platform engineering teams build platforms that are more than just tools. They become powerful assets that help the entire company grow and succeed. Collaboration ensures that these platforms are not only effective and user-friendly but also aligned with the strategic goals of the business, making them invaluable to the organization’s future.

### #4  Platform engineering makes infrastructure teams obsolete
Platform engineering adds a layer that makes things easier for developers, but the complex infrastructure behind the scenes still needs specialists. These infrastructure experts design and manage the foundation that everything runs on. They make sure the system can handle more users and data as it grows. When something goes wrong, they are the ones who fix it to keep everything running smoothly. They also find ways to make the system faster and more efficient.

Platform engineering’s main job is to make life easier for developers by providing tools and services that simplify their work. For example, they might create systems that automate repetitive tasks or make it easier to test new code. However, this doesn't mean infrastructure teams are no longer needed. In fact, platform engineering and infrastructure teams need to work closely together. The platform engineering team builds tools to help developers, while the infrastructure team ensures the underlying systems are strong and reliable.

This collaboration means that both teams can focus on what they do best. Developers get a user-friendly experience with tools that help them work faster and more efficiently. Meanwhile, infrastructure experts make sure everything is stable, secure, and can grow with the company’s needs. For instance, while platform engineers might create an easy-to-use interface for deploying applications, infrastructure specialists make sure the servers and networks can handle the new applications without crashing.

By working together, they create a powerful, efficient environment that supports the entire company. The goal is not to replace each other but to complement each other's skills. This teamwork leads to a stronger, more effective technology foundation for the organization. Everyone brings their expertise.


### #5 Platform engineering requires a completely new approach

Many organizations worry that platform engineering requires a disruptive, rip-and-replace approach to their existing infrastructure. But the reality is, platform engineering can be adopted incrementally. Think of it like a home renovation—you don't have to tear down the entire house. You can start by upgrading key areas like the kitchen or bathroom (e.g., integrating specific development tools or automating deployments) and gradually expand from there.

This means organizations can leverage their existing investments in cloud platforms or on-premises hardware while incorporating platform engineering principles.  Imagine building an extension onto your house—the platform can connect to your existing infrastructure, providing the benefits of platform engineering without requiring a complete rebuild.

Organizations can begin with a small-scale platform engineering implementation, focusing on a specific development team or project. This allows them to test the waters, identify the benefits, and then scale the platform to encompass more teams and applications over time. Think of it like planting a seed—you don't harvest a giant tree overnight. You start small and nurture it until it grows to its full potential.

By adopting platform engineering practices, even in a limited way, organizations lay the groundwork for a more efficient and scalable development environment in the future.

Development teams can experience increased productivity, fewer development team obstacles, and simplified governance of technology choices with self-service and guardrails.

## Simplifying the inner loop for developers

Simplifying the inner and outer loop model is also an important part of improving the development process. 
- In the inner loop, the developer works on the code. 
- In the outer loop, developers push the code to version control for automation, testing, and deployment until it is ready for release. 
Developers need a simple inner loop so that they can focus on finding software solutions, not configuring tools.
Developers need a single place, like a hub, where they can find resources, utilize and generate shareable components, and follow Golden Path templates (templated paths to quick and easy software development).

# Streamline onboarding with Golden Path templates

Red Hat Developer Hub provides Golden Path templates that are essential for fast-tracking development and ensuring organization and consistency. These templates are referred to as golden because they provide gold-standard best practices for developers to follow so your code will be coherent, scalable, and maintainable.

You can streamline application and developer onboarding with Golden Path templates. Golden Paths provide pre-architected and supported approaches to building and deploying a particular piece of software without having to learn all the details of the technology used.

Templates enable self-service for developers. They also provide the best pathway to fix bugs or implement features, enabling developers to speed up the process, thereby making your organization more competitive.

## The two sides of Red Hat Developer Hub

From a consumption perspective, Red Hat Developer Hub perfectly matches the functionality needed for the developer as part of the inner loop. For the first time, a developer has a single place to find everything, from links, integrated development environments (IDEs), and GitHub repos, to documentation and components catalogs added to applications

## How Red Hat Developer Hub benefits developers

Red Hat Developer Hub provides a single place for a developer to work. Finally, there’s a hub for all things a developer needs, such as resources, clusters, and templates. Red Hat Developer Hub provides complete coverage of the inner loop, IDE, direction interaction, and authentication to GitHub.

Developers must understand the complexity of the various tools they use. Learning numerous toolsets as well as the ins and outs of the frameworks, technologies, and components of their organization can be time consuming. The primary goal of Red Hat Developer Hub is to ease the development process and provide an aggregated toolset that reduces the mental overhead of context switching and searching for the core components they need.

Red Hat Developer Hub provides a wizard and template-driven experience for end developers. This makes it very easy to build complex systems from multiple components, including Git source-driven deployments to systems such as Kubernetes and OpenShift. In addition, the provisioning of these components simplifies the knowledge the developer needs. With a couple of clicks and text entry points, developers can convert a template to a running application component without knowing the convoluted technology beneath it.

This gives developers more time to spend on developing rather than configuring development environments and components. Not only is the developer presented with a rich set of components from which to choose, but system administrators can configure these components.

## How Red Hat Developer Hub benefits administrators

Red Hat Developer Hub is built on the Janus open source project, which extends the Backstage open source project, providing a highly configurable and secure development portal and catalog to control which components can be built together. Red Hat Developer Hub extends the functionality through a set of predefined supported plug-ins providing extensions and components to ease the developer's path as they design and build composite applications.

Using code-as-config, administrators can control exactly what developers can interact with and at what level, providing a simple to use and simple to configure mechanism for providing developers with a single point for all things development.

Red Hat Developer Hub also provides a highly configurable authentication model, allowing integration with providers such as GitHub and Keycloak. Administrators can configure authentication methods, templates (i.e., multi-component quick starts and API definitions), and the base definitions. This is a sophisticated tool for building organizational developer portals.
